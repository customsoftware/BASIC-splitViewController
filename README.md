# BASIC-splitViewController
This is a barebones split view controller which enables the following:
1.  Different content in the Master view controller by swapping out Delegate and Data Source
2.  Different detail content by swapping out child viewControllers.
3.  It uses a simplified REDUX model for managing state. Subsequent versions willhave a better REDUX implementation.
