# BASIC-splitViewController
This is a barebones split view controller which enables the following:
1.  Different content in the Master view controller by swapping out Delegate and Data Source classes
2.  Different detail content by swapping out child viewControllers.
3.  It uses a simplified REDUX model for managing state.
